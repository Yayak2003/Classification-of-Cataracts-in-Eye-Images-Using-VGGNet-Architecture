# Classification-of-Cataracts-in-Eye-Images-Using-VGGNet-Architecture
 An eye image classification project that aims to predict eye conditions into three categories: normal, cataracts, and glaucoma. The model used is the VGGNet deep learning architecture, which has been optimized to recognize and distinguish between the three conditions based on eye images.
